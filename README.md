# Clean-And-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys

In this project, our goal is to clean and analyze employee exit surveys to answer the following questions:

1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

We will be working with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education institute in Queensland, Australia (TAFE).
